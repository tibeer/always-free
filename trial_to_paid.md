# Migrate trial account to paid account

Sometimes it is required that you migrate your "trial" account to a paid one, otherwise you'll loose access to it. This behaviour is at least known for:

- Azure
- GCP
- Oracle

Depending on the Cloud, you'll receive an email containing the steps to do.
Hint: Even though the account is now "paid", it does not mean in particular, that you'll get charged for everything now. The root list intends to show only always free resources.

If you do not receive an email, you'll usually get a warning after three months since account creation to upgrade. If even that is not the case, just set yourself a reminder OR even better: Upgrade directly to a paid account. So you do not have to mess with the Cloud consoles again (e.g. when using Terraform).
